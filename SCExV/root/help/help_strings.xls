#controller	function	variable	text
files	upload	PCRTable	Here you can upload your RT-qPCR data using either tab separated tables (samples in rows, genes in columns) or the output files from the Fluidigm analysis software.<br /><br />SCexV expects all data from one plate to be in one file. If somehow the data of one plate did end up in two or more files you can use the Utilities -&gt; File Merger from the menu to concatenate the files.<br /><h5>Warning:</h5> <ul><li>Make sure,  that you never opened the fluidigm outfiles using an office program like EXCEL as this does change file format and breaks the import functionality.</li><li>The gene symbols need to be exactly the same in all RT-qPCR source files. Otherwise the data can not be merged.</li><li>If you add FACS data please make sure, that the sample name in the FACS data is also contained in the PCR sample name (e.g. FACS '<b><i>A9</i></b>' is '<i>Celltype B <b>A9</b></i>' in the PCR data). <br /></li> </ul><br />
files	upload	facsTable	Here you can upload an index sorted FACS datasets.<br /><br />You can upload tab separated tables storing samples in rows and gene expression in columns.<br />Data files created by the BD FACSDiva software.	tables
files	upload	normalize2	<ol></ol>All normalization methods do invert the Ct values!<br />Therefore&nbsp;high values for the PCR analysis do relate to high gene expression. This is not true for the histograms shown at the file upload page as they need to display the raw data in your file.<br /><br />The normalization options:<br /><ol><li>max expression<br />For each cell the expression is normalized to gene showing the lowest Ct value</li><li>median expression<br />The expression values for each cell are normalized to the median expression value of that cell.<br /></li><li>mean control genes<br />The expression is normalized to the mean Ct value of the control genes<br />WARNING: file upload will fail if you have not selected any control gene!</li><li>quantile<br />The Ct values are normalized using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile_normalization" target="_blank">Quantil Normalization</a> - a method commonly used for microarray data</li><li>none<br />The Ct values are only inverted and not normalized in any way<br /></li></ol>
files	upload	rmGenes	Using this option you will exclude genes from the analysis where at least 50% of the cells had the stable max Ct value (999 or whichever max Ct value you did choose). </p><p>Genes not expressed in 100% of the samples are removed by default as they would mess up the downstream analysis..
files	upload	userGroup	This is not used at the moment - do not bother!
files	upload	maxGenes	Based on the positive control genes you can exclude cells that express this gene(s) with a Ct value higher that a max Ct value.<br /><br />WARNING: Using the defaults all cells expressing any control gene at a Ct value more than 25 is excluded.<br /><p></p><p>I recommend to not using this function now, as (1) including these cells makes identification of rare failed cells easier and (2) any clear group of cells can easily be removed later on.<br /></p>
files	upload	controlGenes	After you have uploaded a data file you can select up to 4 control genes using the drop down lists. <br />You will see a histogram for each control gene showing the Ct values for all samples as green bars and the distribution of the Ct values per array in coloured lines.<br /><br />WARNING: By default all cells expressing any control gene at a Ct level of 25 or higher are removed from the analysis.<br />
analyse	index	cluster_on	None supervised clustering can either be applied to the raw data values or the MDS scaled data. <br />You need to try whether the MDS algorithm is able to highlight differences in your cell populations in a better way than the raw data values does it.<br /><br />The not colour coded heatmaps give you an impression of the grouping efficiency based on the raw data whereas the 3D components (scatter) plot visualizes the performance pf the MDS algorithm. <br /><br />Please select the data set to apply the non supervised clustering to - the data you provided (Expression data) or the MDS data. <p></p><p> This option is ignored if you select a user defined grouping.<br /></p>
analyse	index	cluster_by	If you provided FACS data you can select to cluster the samples based on the FACS expression values or FACS MDS data.</p><p>This option is ignored if you did not upload a FACS table, the FACS table did not contain the same samples as the PCR table or you selected a user defined grouping.
analyse	index	cluster_alg	If you choose the hierarchical clustering approach you can select the method applied to the data.<br />Please read the <a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/hclust.html" target="_blank">R documentation for the hclust function</a> for more information.<br />
analyse	index	mds_alg	Select the <b>m</b>ulti<b>d</b>imensional <b>s</b>caling algorithm that should be used for this analysis. <br /><br />PCA 'principal components analysis' is the standard method.<br />LLE and ISOMAP are in contrast to PCA none linear scaling algorithms. For more information please see the implementation in the <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RDRToolbox.html" target="_blank">Bioconductor RDRToolbox</a> package and references therein.<br />
analyse	index	cluster_amount	You can specify the number of groups you want to separate the data into. <br />
analyse	index	K	This option is only important for the LLE and ISOMAP mds analysis. Low numbers speed up the analysis.<br /><br />changed<br />
analyse	index	UG	Here you can select one of the previously created groupings. The 'Group by plate ID' option is automatically created during the upload process. All other groupings are based on gene expression differences. <br /><br />Custom groupings are created using the option in the 'Custom Groupings' menu. All further help on the separate grouping options can be found on the respective pages. <br /><br />
gene_group	index	GOI	Here you can select one of the genes in your analysis to show the normalized expression values as histogram. Based on the information shown in the histogram you can define cut off values.
gene_group	index	Cutoff	The cut off values should be given as a space separated list. A string like that : <form><input id="cutoff" name="cutoff" type="text" value='-10, -15, -3 0'  readonly /></form> would result in 5 groups based on the expression of the displayed gene. </BR> The samples would be grouped like that:<ol><li> expression < -15 </li><li> expression >= -15 and < -10</li><li>expression >=-10 and < -3</li><li>expression >= -3 and < 0</li><li>and finally expression >= 0</li></ol>- 
grouping_2d	index	gx	Please select the gene you want to place on the x axis of the scatter plot.
grouping_2d	index	gy	Please select the gene you want to place on the y axis of the scatter plot.
analyse	index	gege_expreesion	The violine plots depict the expression for one gene over your whole dataset. The colours are consistent over the whole page and mark the same samples in the violone plots, the MDS plots and the heatmaps.<br /><br />The x axis of the violine plots depicts the number of expressing samples / the number of samples in this group.<br />
files	upload	negContr	Negative control genes should not be expressed in any sample. Therefore all cells that show expression of any negative control gene will be removed from the analysis.<br /><br />In addition all negative control genes are removed from the analysis.<br />
files	upload	somethingElse	Why can't I do that once more???? wuegfuwefgbfv And one more....<div><br /></div>
dropsamples	index	Samples	Select the samples you want to remove from the analysis.<br />Multiple selections are possible.<br />
dropsamples	index	RefSeq	Here you can add a string that matches all samples you want to remove.<br />E.g. you can use the string 'Ref' (without the quotes) to delete the samples Ref_1, Ref_2, Ref_whatever or whateverRef.<br /><br />You can also use perl style regular expressions like<br /><br />\d = match any number 0-9<br /><br />'Ref_\\d' would match to Ref_1 and Ref_2 but not to  Ref_whatever or whateverRef.<br /><br />'Ref_\\d\\d' would match to Ref_11 and Ref_12 but neither&nbsp; Ref_1 or Ref_2 nor to  Ref_whatever or whateverRef.<br /><br />'Ref_\d+' would match to Ref_11, Ref_12,&nbsp; Ref_1 and Ref_2 but not to  Ref_whatever or whateverRef.<br />
files	upload	PCRTable2	PCRTable #2 is a PCR data set that is paired with the first PCR table in regards to the FACS data.<br /><br />You have to use this option if you want use 48 well PCR plates together with 96 well FACS plates. As in this setting one FACS table corresponds to two PCR tables.<br />You must not use this field if you use the 96 well PCR analysis together with 96 well FACS data.<br /><br />In other words - one upload process has to contain all PCR and FACS data values for all used samples.<br />
files	upload	use_pass_fail	The data files created by the Fluidigm software contain Pass/Fail&nbsp;information for each Ct value. <br /><br />Setting this value to 'True' the failed Ct values will be ignored by the tool setting the values to 999.<br /><br />Setting this option to 'False' will still use the reported Ct values. This is especially important if you manualy set a Ct value to Fail.<br /><br />
scrapbook	link	button	The scrap book can be used to store pictures and text during a whole analysis session. In addition the tool logs all actions that modify the data set. Therefore the scrapbook is an easy way to document what you are doing any why you are doing it.<br /><br />To store pictures you just need to draw a picture from the active page onto the Scrapbook button. A new page asking for a caption text will open. Submitting this page will store the figure in the scrapbook and update the page to show all entries of the scrapbook.<br /><br />To add text to the scrapbook you simply click on the Scarpbook button. A new page will open (pop up) that asks for the text to store.<br /><br />The scrapbook is a web page that is part of the down-loadable zip archive (/Scrapbook/Scrapbook.html).<br /><br />Best practice is to close the scrapbook each time you used it so that it gets the focus each time you try to add new content.<br /><br />
scrapbook	wrong	dataset	Sorry, this data type is not supported!<br />
mergefiles	index	datatype	Which data type do you want to merge?
mergefiles	index	name	The new file will have this name. You can of cause also change that name later on.
mergefiles	index	use_pass_fail	If you want to merge PCR result files in table or heatmap format you can specify whether to drop (true) all expression values that come from  failed reactions or to keep these values (false).
mergefiles	index	source	A common problem is having one RT-qPCR plate file, but two index run files that describe the same cells that are part of the one other file data-set.<br />Upload all INDEX files corresponding to the one RT-qPCR file here.<br />Remember to give the file a name like FACS_Array3.csv if you want to group this new file with the RT-qPCR_Array3.csv file.<br /><br /><br />
files	upload	orderKey	SCexV allows you to sort your files according to a string identifier followed by a number.<br />For analysis sessions including FACS data the usage of this feature is highly recommended!<br /><br />How does it work?<br /><br />The default key word is 'Array'. If you place the combination of Array followed by a number in your file names the number will be the sorting key.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />Three files; (1) Array2_T_cells.csv&nbsp; (2) B_cells_Array1.csv (3) NKArray3.csv<br /><br />would be ordered like that:<br /><br />(1) B_cells_Array1.csv <br />(2) Array2_T_cells.csv <br />(3) NKArray3.csv<br /><br /><br />
analyse	index	cluster_type	SCexV provides two different clustering algorithms: (1) hirarchical clustering and (2) kmeans clustering.<br /><br />Choose which performs best on your data set.<br />
pvalues	index	stat_table	This table contains the statistics results calculated for your actual grouping.<br />The gene symbol together with a list of p values is displayed.<br />P values are calculated using the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23267174" target="_self">SingleCellAssay R libraray (publication)</a>; the linear p value is based on the biological hypothesis, that a cell group that expresses a gene at a higher level does also express the gene in more cells of that group. The p value&nbsp; is created using a bootstrap approach. For more details please read the libs/Tool_PValues.R R library.<br /><br />A click on the table row updates the image to the right. <br />
pvalues	index	boot	This value will affect the minimum p value reported for the linear model and the total calculation time. A higher value will report a lower minimal p value but take longer to calculate. The other p values are not affected.<br /><br />There are a list of p values created for each gene, a continuous, a discrete and a hurdle p value that is calculated unsing the SingleCellAssay R package and the linear_model p value that is described in the second SCexV paper.<br />In short this model is based on the hypothesis, that a given expression value x will be reported at a Ct value that follows a normal distribution. If the value x leads to a Ct distribution close to the detection limit of the assay, only a subset of cells expressing the gene at a level of x will have a valid CT value.<br />As the level of x rises, the fraction of cells showing a valid CT level as well as the reported Ct level will rise accordingly. This correlation is the basis of the linear model. The boot value defines the amount of bootstrap cycles to run.<br />
analyse	index	plotsvg	Images in scalable vector format (svg) are especially well suited for re-scaling and re-formatting. If you want to use either the heatmaps or the violin plots in connection with e.g. Illustrator you should set this option to 'Yes'.<br /><br />Creating both png and svg pictures is slower than creating png figures only. <br />The web front end uses only the png files.
analyse	index	zscoredVioplot	The expression distribution plots are able to display either the untransformed ct values or the (default) z-scored values.<br /><br />The z-scored values are also the basis of the heatmaps and therefore are selected as default here, too.<br />
analyse	index	use_beans	The expression distributions plots can be plotted using two different plot types:<br /> <ol><li>Violin plots <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vioplot/" target="_blank">(R package documentation)<br /></a> that show both, the distribution of the data as well as the boxplot representation of it.</li><li>Bean plots <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/beanplot/" target="_blank">(R package ducumentation)</a> that also depict the distribution (slightly different to the violin plot) and each value of the plotted data.</li></ol>Which plot to use is up to you, but the default is 'beanplot'.<br />
analyse	index	plot_neg	The cells that do not express a gene are included in the expression distribution plots by default. <br /><br />For some genes, the not expressing samples might hide important level changes in the expressed samples by enlarging the scale of the y axis. Therefore we have added an option to hide non expressing cells in the expression distribution plots.<br />
analyse	index	move_neg	The expression value of failed genes are set to an arbitrary value of 0 for the ct values and -20 for the z-scored values.<br /><br />This arbitrary value lies far away from the real data and therefore complicates plots including the non-expressing cells.<br /><br />Using this option, the expression value for the non-expressing cells is set to the minimal expression value of the whole dataset - 1. <br />
